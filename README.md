# Dynamic To-Do List Mod for Valheim

This is a Valheim mod that adds a dynamic [To-Do List](ValheimModToDo/README.md) to Valheim that tracks the resources you have and still need to completed crafting or building recipes on the list.

The To-Do List shows the list of to-do recipes and what resources are required. The panel also shows how many of the each resource is needed in total, how many you have in your inventory now and if you need to collect more of them.

Shoutout to game Satisfactory for inspirations.
